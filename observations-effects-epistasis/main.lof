\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {A.1}{\ignorespaces The ELF3-TR variation is not correlated with ELF3 expression. (A) Histogram of ELF3-TR copy number across 181 accessions. TR copy number was determined by Sanger sequencing. (B) ELF3 expression levels in selected natural accessions were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Expression values are given relative to the Col-0 wild-type reference. Three biological replicates with three technical replicates each were used to obtain expression values. Bars indicate $\pm $ SEM. (C and D) ELF3-TR transgenic lines are expression-matched in both genetic backgrounds. (C) elf3-4, Ws; (D) elf3-200, Col. ELF3 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR (for primers see Table S6) in pooled 10-d-old seedlings that were grown under LD and collected at ZT 20 for each independently generated ELF3-TR transgenic line. ELF3 expression levels are shown relative to either Ws (C) or Col-0 (D) wild-types. Because ELF3 expression levels are known to substantially affect ELF3-dependent phenotypes \cite {Kim2005}, ELF3 expression is an important variable to consider in our assessment of polyQ tract-length effects. We made efforts to consider only lines within a certain range of ELF3 expression and to test multiple independent lines per ELF3-TR allele (Tables A2�A4), but because of the technical constraints of transgenic plant construction, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that ELF3 expression partially explains our observations. Although the effects of both ELF3 expression level and ELF3-TR copy number were highly significant, they appear to be largely independent. For example, the ELF3-23Q and ELF3-16Q alleles, which were among the most distinct ELF3-TR alleles in both backgrounds, had very similar ranges of ELF3 expression. In Ws, the alleles ELF3-7Q, ELF3-23Q, and ELF3-10Q phenocopied an elf3 loss-of-function mutant for some phenotypes. Their ELF3 expression levels, however, were very similar to the ELF3-16Q allele, which complemented many ELF3 functions in elf3-4. As observed with individual ELF3-TR alleles, the phenotypic effects of ELF3 expression levels appear to be largely independent of ELF3-TR copy number, which consistently explained a larger portion of phenotypic variation. \relax }}{51}{figure.A.1}
