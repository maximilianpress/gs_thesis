Rival et al. 2014 File S2: sequencing of PFT1-STR in A. thaliana strains.

Included in this directory are all raw sequencing results comparing PFT1 sequences between strains (accessions) of Arabidopsis thaliana.

".seq" files contain raw (untrimmed) sequences from each sequencing reaction.
".ab1" files contain traces from each sequencing reaction.

the filenames can be interpreted as follows:

PFT1_C24-A4-Primerplate2-A4.ab1: the trace file for sequencing PFT1 in strain C24 using primer 2. A4 is just a reference to the plate/strip tube. 

Each strain's STR-encoding DNA was sequenced using 2 primers- one (primer 2) that reads forward (CAA=GLU), and one (primer 1) that reads reverse (TTG=GLU).
