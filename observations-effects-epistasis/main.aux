TR copy number was determined by Sanger sequencing. (B) ELF3 expression levels in selected natural accessions were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Expression values are given relative to the Col-0 wild-type reference. Three biological replicates with three technical replicates each were used to obtain expression values. Bars indicate $\pm $ SEM. (C and D) ELF3-TR transgenic lines are expression-matched in both genetic backgrounds. (C) elf3-4, Ws; (D) elf3-200, Col. ELF3 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR (for primers see Table S6) in pooled 10-d-old seedlings that were grown under LD and collected at ZT 20 for each independently generated ELF3-TR transgenic line. ELF3 expression levels are shown relative to either Ws (C) or Col-0 (D) wild-types. Because ELF3 expression levels are known to substantially affect ELF3-dependent phenotypes \cite  {Kim2005}, ELF3 expression is an important variable to consider in our assessment of polyQ tract-length effects. We made efforts to consider only lines within a certain range of ELF3 expression and to test multiple independent lines per ELF3-TR allele (Tables A2�A4), but because of the technical constraints of transgenic plant construction, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that ELF3 expression partially explains our observations. Although the effects of both ELF3 expression level and ELF3-TR copy number were highly significant, they appear to be largely independent. For example, the ELF3-23Q and ELF3-16Q alleles, which were among the most distinct ELF3-TR alleles in both backgrounds, had very similar ranges of ELF3 expression. In Ws, the alleles ELF3-7Q, ELF3-23Q, and ELF3-10Q phenocopied an elf3 loss-of-function mutant for some phenotypes. Their ELF3 expression levels, however, were very similar to the ELF3-16Q allele, which complemented many ELF3 functions in elf3-4. As observed with individual ELF3-TR alleles, the phenotypic effects of ELF3 expression levels appear to be largely independent of ELF3-TR copy number, which consistently explained a larger portion of phenotypic variation. \relax }}{51}{figure.A.1}}

(I) PC1 and PC2. Note that PC1�s orientation is inverted relative to PCAs including Ws-background plants (A and B: i.e., elf3-200 is to the negative end of the axis, and Col is at the positive end); this does not affect interpretation. In contrast to PCAs including Ws data, PC2 of Col data alone represents the differential response of LD and SD phenotypes to ELF3-polyQ copy number variation.

(A) Measured circadian period of CCR::LUC expression oscillation for each ELF3-TR allele. Bars correspond to 99\% confidence intervals for this proportion. (B) Measured RAE of CCR::LUC expression oscillation for each ELF3-TR allele. Bars correspond to 99\% confidence intervals for this proportion. Plants with RAE <0.4 are considered to have a robust circadian clock. (C) Estimated RAE and circadian period for each ELF3-TR allele. Points are means, dotted ellipses represent SEMs, and genotype labels indicate ELF3-TR copy number. Bioluminescence of the CCR2::LUC reporter present in ELF3-TR transgenic lines was used to measure circadian parameters (period and RAE). Seedlings were entrained in 12-h light:12-h dark cycles for 5 d and released to LL on the sixth day. Note that plants with high RAE have by definition unreliable estimates of circadian period.

PCA of phenotypic data from all ELF3-TR alleles in both elf3-4 (Ws accession) and elf3-200 (Col accession) backgrounds. (A) Biplot of PC1 and PC2, graphically showing the contribution of phenotypes to PCs as black arrows. Note that for the biplot representation, PC1 and PC2 are transformed to the same scale (bottom and left axes), whereas phenotype contributions (in red) are allowed to differ in scale (top and right axes). Phenotypes are hypocotyl length in short and long days (SD hylen and LD hylen), DTF in short and long days (SD DTF and LD DTF), and FLN in long days (LD FLN). Wild-type plants are characterized by late flowering (large SD and LD DTF, many rosette leaves) and short hypocotyls (small SD and LD hylen), relative to elf3 loss-of-function mutants. Text in red represents a given allele in the Ws background (transgenics in elf3-4), and text in blue represents alleles in the Col background (transgenics in elf3-200). (B) PC1 and PC2.
